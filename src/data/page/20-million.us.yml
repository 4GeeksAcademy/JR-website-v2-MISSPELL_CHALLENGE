      When we launched 4Geeks back in 2015, we had three fundamental goals:
        - To be a top-quality school where people can learn coding skills and improve their future prospects.
        - To help graduates secure job opportunities right after completing the program.
        - To make our high-quality coding education accessible to as many people as possible.
